			<h2>About Us</h2>

			<p>
			Life Force global is formed by a group of Australian in 2015 with a vision to provide the best natural organic products as close to the mother nature could provided to us.  
			</p>
			<p>
			We are living in an era so called technological advanced, we are subjected to produces that are genettically modified, chemically fertilized which unfortunately become more and more popular. 
			</p>
			<p>
			LFG group believes mother nature could provide enough nourishment for human's need and we should focus to harvest and preserve these goodness instead of synthesis from chemical procesd which our body could not assimilate.
			</p>
			<p>

			All LFG products use natural physical processes with no chemical preservatives or additives nor any synthetic materials. We created a series of probiotics and other products like Aged Magnesium Oil which is concentrated from deep sea water.
			</p>
			<p>
			We endeavour to bring more and more products develop in the same believe and hope to benefit our members and their family. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Join us today and see the different for yourself.
